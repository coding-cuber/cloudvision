# cloudvision

This app was developed for the Science Talent Search Victoria 2021.

Cloudvision is an app designed for learning, collecting, scanning and analysing clouds. Features include:

- A cloud collection gallery for ease of access to saved clouds.
- A cloud scanner that makes use of the device's camera and machine learning to output the cloud type.
- A collection of learning resources about clouds and the creation of the application.


**Technical info:**

Cloudvision was built using the Flutter framework. All front-end code is written in Dart. 
Cloudvision also makes use of TensorFlow machine learning and the Teachable Machine by Google.
A huge thanks to Havard Dataverse's CCSN Database of cloud images that were used for training the machine
(https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/CADDPD).
